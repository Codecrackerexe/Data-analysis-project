# Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing a public dataset of E-fraudulent transactions. The dataset was sourced from Kaggle and the entire project was implemented using Google Colab. The objective was to explore the data, identify patterns, and apply a machine learning algorithm to detect fraudulent transactions.

## Project Walkthrough

1. **Dataset Exploration:**
   - Extracted the public dataset from Kaggle.
   - Conducted initial exploration to identify anomalies and optimize the dataset for analysis.

2. **Data Manipulation:**
   - Performed data manipulation using Python libraries such as:
     - [NumPy](https://numpy.org/): For numerical operations.
     - [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/): For handling and processing tabular data.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Visualized data insights using:
     - [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/): For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
     - [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/): For generating informative and attractive statistical graphics.
   - Built various charts and plots for better understanding of the dataset.

4. **Machine Learning Implementation:**
   - Applied the **Random Forest Classifier** algorithm to classify fraudulent transactions.
   - Utilized the [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/) library for implementing the machine learning model.

5. **Results:**
   - Calculated and displayed the accuracy of the Random Forest Classifier.
   - Derived meaningful conclusions based on the analysis and results.
